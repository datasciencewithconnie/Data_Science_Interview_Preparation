7.        What loss function will you use to measure multi-label problems
8.        Let’s say now you want to identify a threshold for a classifier that predicts whether a customer will sign up to prime or not. What criteria could we use to find the threshold?
9.        In the model we developed, we have a billion positive samples and 200,000 negative samples. If you were to review our model before we put it on the website, what would you look for in the model to ensure this model is not bad?
10.        Could you describe how you train this Context-awareness entity ranking model?
11.        What's regularization，Why regularization， l1 vs l2 Difference
12.        解释bagging和boosting， boosting要求每个iteration的training set都一样吗？（it depends）
13.        说一些dimensions reduction的方法（我说了pca），然后让我解释一下pca怎么work的。我还说了l1 regularization也可以用来reduce dimensions，还有一些embedding的technique也可以。又问如果要present model to business，用pca还是l1好（l1，可解释性）
14.        gradient descent和stochastic gradient descent的区别
15.        vanilla gradient descent 和 Gradient Descent With Momentum 的区别
16.        说一个computer vision的framework，我不是做CV的，所以只说了ResNet。他问和vanilla cnn有什么区别？我说不清楚ResNet framework的细节，不过一般可以加dropout layer和pooling
17.        rnn和lstm的区别，（lstm有个memory gate， 可以防止gradient vanishing）
18.        说nlp的deep learning模型。（我不是做nlp，只说了gbt3，bert，但并不懂细节）。面试韩国小哥就放过了我
19.        Explain differences between linear and logistic regression. What’s the loss function for logistic regression? How is the loss function derived? (hint: Maximum likelihood estimation). check 1point3acres for more.
20.        what’re the common metrics for evaluating linear models? What’s the equivalent of R^2 in logistic regression? what’re the common metrics for evaluating logistic regression models?
21.        How to minimize loss function in linear regression training? Explain both numerical and mathematical way of finding minimum. Explain difference between gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent. What’re the advantages of stochastic gradient descent?
22.        Should we rescale features before gradient descent? why?
23.        What’s the advantages of decision trees? Is feature scaling necessary for training decision trees? What’re random forest and gradient boosting trees? is the base tree in gradient
24.        es between CNN and RNN? Are you familiar with transformer models? Explain it. What’re the advantages of transformer models?
