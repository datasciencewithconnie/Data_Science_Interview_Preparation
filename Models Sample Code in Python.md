# Common Machine Learning Algorithms and sample code in Python

Today, as a data scientist, I can build data-crunching machines with complex algorithms for a few dollars per hour. But reaching here wasnâ€™t easy! I had my dark days and nights.

The idea behind creating this guide is to simplify the journey of aspiring data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts across the world. Through this guide, I will enable you to work on machine learning problems and gain from experience. I am providing a high-level understanding of various machine learning algorithms along with Python codes to run them. These should be sufficient to get your hands dirty.

### Here is the list of commonly used machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be applied to almost any data problem:

* [Linear Regression](#linear-Regression)
* [Logistic Regression](#logistic-regression)
* [Decision Tree](#decision-tree)
* [SVM](#svm)
* [Naive Bayes](#naive-bayes)
* [kNN](#knn)
* [K-Means](#k-means)
* [Random Forest](#random-forest)
* [Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms](#dimensionality-reduction-algorithms)
* [Gradient Boosting algorithms](#gradient-boosting-algorithm)
  * [GBM](#gbm)
  * [XGBoost](#xgboost)
  * [LightGBM](#lightgbm)
  * [CatBoost](#catboost)

#### Before dive deep into the specific algorithm, broadly speaking, there are 3 major types of machine learning algorithm.

### Supervised Learning

This algorithm consist of a target / outcome variable (or dependent variable) which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors (independent variables). Using these set of variables, we generate a function that map inputs to desired outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data. Examples of Supervised Learning: Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression etc.

### Unsupervised Learning

In this algorithm, we do not have any target or outcome variable to predict / estimate. It is used for clustering population in different groups, which is widely used for segmenting customers in different groups for specific intervention. Examples of Unsupervised Learning: Apriori algorithm, K-means.

### Reinforcement Learning

Using this algorithm, the machine is trained to make specific decisions. It works this way: the machine is exposed to an environment where it trains itself continually using trial and error. This machine learns from past experience and tries to capture the best possible knowledge to make accurate business decisions. Example of Reinforcement Learning: Markov Decision Process

  
# Linear Regression

* It is used to estimate real coutinuous values (cost of cars, number of calls, total sales etc.) Here, we establish relationship between independent and dependent variables by fitting a best line.
* The coefficients are derived based on minimizing the sum of squared difference of distance between data points and regression line.
* Linear Regression is mainly of two types: 
        *Simple Linear Regression:  characterized by one independent variable
        *Multiple Linear Regression: characterized by multiple (more than 1) independent variables (aka polynomial or curvilinear regression)
