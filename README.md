# Data_Science_Interview_Preparation
The purpose of this repo is to help prepare for data science related interviews. 
There are so many data science interview preparation materials all over the place. This is more of a quick reference rather than an in-depth study material. No matter you're an experienced data scientist or a fresh new graduate. Stick on one plan and finished it, you'll get an yes soon or later. 

Finger Cross!

## SQL
### Practice Materials

* **MySQL**: Leetcode (Practice 3-5 times all database question, start from high frequency)
* **Postgresql**: StrataScratch (Pratice real SQL questions from real data science company, filter by company's name)
* **Basic Concepts**:
Left Join/Right Join/Inner Join/Full Outer Join
Window Function ( RANK, LAG, LEAD)

## python
**Data Manipulation**: StrataScratch (Pratice solving sql problems in python Pandas DataFrame. Great discount if you register with university email )
**Algorithm**: Leetcode (Start from high frequent easy and median questions, key is not how many you solved but how many you actually understand)
