# Data_Science_Interview_Preparation
The purpose of this repo is to help prepare for data science related interviews. 
There are so many data science interview preparation materials all over the place. This is more of a quick reference rather than an in-depth study material. No matter you're an experienced data scientist or a fresh new graduate. Let's stick on one plan and you'll get an yes soon or later.

## Different Types of Data Science Roles

* **Product Analytics**: This type of roles focus on A/B Testing and product analytics. Need to have strong business sense and SQL skills. Python questions are barely asked for those roles (Eg. Facebook Analytics DS, Tiktok Ads DS, Uber product analyst)
* **Marketing Monetization**: This type of roles focus on optimizing marketing portfolio, do a lot of work about casual inference and data visualization. (Eg. Spotify marketing DS )
* **Machine Learning Modeling**: This type of roles focus on modeling(ML/NLP), Phd preferred but not required. Interview questions will includes Machine learning model concept questions,data manipulation in SQL and Python at least 1 round and algorithm in Python/R  (Eg. Apple map routing optimization)

## SQL
### Practice Materials

* **MySQL**: [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) (Practice 3-5 times all database question, start from high frequency)
* **Postgresql**: [StrataScratch](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding) (Pratice real SQL questions from real data science company, filter by company's name)
* **Basic Concepts**:
Left Join/Right Join/Inner Join/Full Outer Join
Window Function ( RANK, LAG, LEAD)

## Python

* **Data Manipulation**: [StrataScratch](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding) (Pratice solving sql problems in python Pandas DataFrame. Great discount if you register with university email )
* **Algorithm**: [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)  (Start from high frequency easy and median questions, key is not how many you solved but how many you actually understand)
